<p style="font-size:20px" >Cardiovascular workouts (or simply cardio) elevate your heart rate. These are some of the most effective forms of exercise for weight loss because the greater your heartbeat, the more fat you’ll burn.To lose weight or maintain weight loss, you’ll need up to 300 minutes of moderate physical activity a week.This averages about 60 minutes, five days a week.If you’re busy, split up your cardio into three smaller workouts a day. One example: Exercise 20 minutes in the morning before work, walk 20 minutes on your lunch break, and exercise for 20 minutes after dinner.

<p align="center"> 
<h2 style="color:#CC3333" ><center> Great cardio workouts to help you to manage your Weight:</center></h2>
<h2 >1. Low-intensity cardio </h2><br>
</h2>
<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/Low-intensity cardio.gif" alt="cardio" border="2"  >
</div>
<ul style="font-size:20px">
  <li> You don’t have to exercise at a high intensity to lose weight. If you’re a beginner or have physical limitations, low-intensity cardio can also help you burn calories and drop pounds.</li><br>
<li>    These workouts include jogging, bicycling, power walking, swimming, and aerobics. </li><br>
   <li> Start slow and gradually up the intensity as you adjust to your new routine.</li><br>
  <li>  Aim for 60 minutes of low-intensity cardio five days a week.</li><br> 
    <li>As you become more physically fit, carry hand weights while jogging, walking, or doing aerobics.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 >2. Jump rope</h2><br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/SelfishSecondEquestrian-size_restricted.gif">
</div><br>
<p style="font-size:20px">
Jumping rope not only improves coordination and cognitive function, but the intensity of this workout elevates your heart rate, helping you burn about 1,300 calories per hour, explains Shaikh.
<ul style="font-size:20px">
  <li>Warm up with 8 to 10 jumps.  </li><br>
  <li>Then jump continuously for 1 1/2 minutes.</li><br>
  <li> Rest for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat.</li><br>
  <li> Complete 3 sets.</li><br>
  <li>You can switch up your routine, too.</li><br>
  <li> Jump one set on a single leg, one set with both legs, and one set while running in place. </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Burpees <br></h2>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/burpees.gif"></div><br>
<p style="font-size:20px">Burpees combine squats, jumps, and pushups. It’s an effective workout because you’re burning fat from your overall body, and you’re training multiple muscle groups like your chest, legs, and core, says Shaikh.
<ul style="font-size:20px">
  <li>    Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms by your sides.</li><br>
    <li> Lower into a squat position and place your hands on the floor.</li><br>
    <li> Kick or step your legs back into a plank position.</li><br>
    <li> Jump or step your legs forward to return to a squat position.</li><br>
    <li> Return to the standing position.</li><br>
    <li> Do 10 reps in 30 seconds and then rest for 30 seconds.</li><br>
  <li> Repeat for 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>4. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) </h2><br>
<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/GreenTanHorsemouse-size_restricted.gif"></div><br><br>
<p style="font-size:20px">This cardio workout has increased in popularity due to its ability to maximize calorie burn and fat loss. It involves intense bursts of exercise to elevate your heart rate, followed by 15 seconds of rest.<br>
<strong>HIIT</strong> is great if you don’t have a lot of time. You’re able to exercise for a shorter length of time, yet complete a more intense and strenuous workout. As a result, you’ll continue to burn calories for hours after the workout, notes Shaikh.
<h2>Here’s an example of a HIIT routine:</h2>
<ul style="font-size:20px">
	<li>Complete butt kicks for 45 seconds, and rest for 15 seconds.</li><br>
<li> Next, perform jumping lunges for 45 seconds, followed by 15 seconds of rest.</li><br>
    <li> Complete burpees for 45 seconds, and rest for 15 seconds.</li><br>
    <li> Repeat for 10 to 20 minutes.</li><br>
    <li> You can also incorporate other movements like mountain climbers and jump squats.
      Or, you can try to complete a HIIT workout on a treadmill:</li><br>
    <li> Warm up for 5 minutes.</li><br>
    <li> Then sprint at a high-intensity speed for 1 minute.</li><br>
    <li> Walk for 30 seconds, and then sprint again at a high-intensity speed for 1 minute.</li><br>
    <li> Complete 8 to 10 sets.</li></ul><br>

	  5 strength-training exercises 
	</center></h2><br>
	<h2>1. Kettlebell swings</h2><br>
	<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/kettlebell-swings.gif"></div>
	<br>
	<p style="font-size:20px">This full-body, demanding workout will amp up your heart rate while increasing your arm and leg strength and helping you develop a strong core, explains Blozy.
	<ul style="font-size:20px">
	<li>Stand tall with your feet together and hold a kettlebell with both hands in front of your thighs.</li><br>
	<li>Step out to the side with one foot. With your knees slightly bent, push your hips back, and swing the kettlebell back and between your legs.</li><br>
	 <li>Thrust your hips forward as you stand up.     </li><br>
	 <li> Complete a two-handed kettlebell swing for 20 seconds.   </li>  <br>
	 <li> Rest for 8 seconds.     </li><br>
	 <li> Repeat 8 sets.</li>
	</ul>
<p style="font-size:20px">Blozy recommends lifting faster to boost your heart rate even more and have a more cardio-intense workout.<br>

<h2>2. Push-ups</h2><br>
<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/push-up.gif" alt="push-up">
</div>
<p style="font-size:20px">
Pushups are an excellent exercise for stabilizing the core, building upper body strength, and increasing muscle mass in your arms.
If you’re a beginner, start with 3 sets of 10 reps. Rest 60 to 90 seconds between each set. Gradually increase your number of reps as your strength improves.
<ul style="font-size:20px">
  <li> Get down on all fours, placing your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.</li><br>
    <li> Straighten your arms and legs.</li><br>
    <li> Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.</li><br>
    <li> Pause, then push yourself back up.      </li>
    <li> Repeat. </li>
</ul>	
	
<h2>3. Lunges</h2>
<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/lunges.gif" alt="lunges">
</div>

<p style="font-size:20px">
The options lunges provide because you can do them forward, backward, weighted, and unweighted. <br>
For the weighted version, hold a kettlebell or weight plate next to your chest, or make it even more challenging and lift the weight overhead.
<ul style="font-size:20px">
<li>Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Engage your core.</li><br>
<li>Take a big step forward with right leg.</li><br>
<li>Lower your body until right thigh is parallel to the floor and right shin is vertical.</li><br>
<li>Press into right heel to drive back up to starting position.</li><br>
<li>Repeat on the other side.</li><br>
<li>Complete 1 set of 8 to 12 lunges per leg.</li>
</ul>
	
	<h2>4. Step-ups</h2>
	<div align="center" ><img src="exercise wt loss/step-up.gif" alt="step-up" >
	</div>
<p style="font-size:20px">
Step-ups as another great exercise to strengthen the legs while stabilizing your core and lower back muscles. “Start with a small step height (6 to 12 inches) and then progress to a higher height, like 24 to 30 inches.
Before you start, find a step, chair, or bench that when you place your foot on it, your knee bends to a 90-degree angle. The weight benches or plyo boxes are often the right height, but a dining room chair can work too for an at-home strength-training session.
<ul style="font-size:20px">
<li>To start, place your entire right foot onto the bench or chair.</li><br>
<li> Press through your right heel as you step onto the bench, bringing your left foot to meet your left so you are standing on the bench.</li><br>
<li>Return to the starting position by stepping down with the right foot, then the left so both feet are on the floor.</li><br>
<li>Complete 15 steps leading with the left foot, then repeat another 15 steps leading with your left foot. Do three sets.</li>
	</ul>
	
<h2>5. Deadlifts</h2>
<div align="center"><img src="exercise wt loss/deadlifts.gif" border="2" ></div>	
<p style="font-size:20px">
 Deadlifts as an exercise to build muscles in both the lower and upper body, while reducing fat. She encourages lightening the load to 50 to 70 percent of your max, and increasing the reps so it’ll feel more like cardio than weight training.
<ul style="font-size:20px">
 <li> Walk to the bar. Stand with your mid-foot under the bar.
Grab the bar.</li><br> 
 <li> Bend over without bending your legs.Bend your knees.</li><br>
 <li> Drop into position by bending your knees until your shins touch the bar.</li><br>
 <li> Lift your chest. Straighten your back by raising you chest.</li><br>
 <li> Pull. Take a big breath, hold it and stand up with the weight.</li><br>
 <li>Hold the weight for a second at the top, with locked hips and knees. </li> <br>
 <li>Then return the weight to the floor by moving your hips back while bending your legs. </li><br>
 <li> Rest a second at the bottom and repeat. </li><br>
 <li> Do five reps on the StrongLifts 5×5 program.</li>
