<h1 style="font-size:4vw">The 5 Best BCAAs of 2021, According to a Dietitian</h1>



<div class="roww">
  <div class="columnn leftt">
   
 <p style="font-size:25px">When you perform intense workouts, it’s important to rest, recover, and fuel your body with the right nutrients, especially protein.
 While you can meet most—if not all—of your dietary needs through proper nutrition, some athletes choose to supplement with branched-chain amino acids or BCAAs.
 BCAAs represent three essential amino acids: valine, leucine, and isoleucine. These essential amino acids are commonly found in protein-rich food such as meat, dairy,
 and legumes, but they are also bundled together in capsule or powder form and sold as a dietary supplement.

There's little evidence to support the claim that BCAAs improve endurance performance; however, research shows BCAAs may help build muscle size and support recovery
 when used with a resistance training program. In fact, the International Society of Sports Nutrition supports the use of branched-chain amino acids as a means to meet 
the increased protein needs of athletes but recommends choosing whole food options as the primary protein source.</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:23px;"><b>Best Powder: Thorne Research Amino Complex</b></p></a>
    <p style="font-size:23px">
  If you're looking for a high-quality, great-tasting BCAA powder, Thorne's Amino Complex is a fantastic choice. 
The delicious berry-flavored powder is sweetened with stevia and uses no artificial flavors. Each scoop contains eleven amino acids, 
including all nine essential amino acids (which includes the three BCAAs) as well as cysteine and tyrosine. These two amino acids are known as 
conditionally essential amino acids, which are needed in higher quantities during times of physical stress, such as exercise recovery.

The powder is free of gluten, dairy, and soy. The product is NSF Certified for Sport, meaning that it is tested to be sure it is free of 
banned substances and compliant with label claims. Thorne recommends mixing one scoop with at least six ounces of water.

<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:23px;"><b>Best Hypoallergenic: Pure Encapsulations BCAA Powder</b></p></a>
    <p style="font-size:23px">
If you have allergies, it can be hard to find a quality supplement that is 100 percent free of your specific allergens. Pure Encapsulations is devoted to formulating products using the purest ingredients to deliver top-quality, hypoallergenic products. Their BCAA Powder is no exception. The BCAA powder is free of wheat, gluten, egg, peanuts, soy, dairy, shellfish, magnesium stearate, hydrogenated fat, and artificial colors and sweeteners.

One scoop of the 2:1:1 (leucine:isoleucine:valine) ratio powder provides 1,500 milligrams of leucine and 750 milligrams each of isoleucine and valine. Pure Encapsulations recommends mixing one scoop of the non-GMO powder with 10 ounces of water or juice once daily.

<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:23px;"><b>Best Unflavored: Muscle Feast BCAA Powder 4:1:1 Ratio</b></p></a>
    <p style="font-size:23px">
 Many BCAAs come in super strong fruity flavors that don't appeal to all taste buds. Additionally, some supplements use artificial flavors and sweeteners which may be detrimental to your health. Choosing an unflavored variety, like the Muscle Feast BCAA Powder, is a good choice to reap the benefits of BCAAs without unnecessary flavors and ingredients.

Muscle Feast's Unflavored BCAA Powder comes in a 4:1:1 ratio and is keto-friendly, vegan, and sugar-free. The supplement contains only BCAAs and sunflower lecithin for mixability. Specifically, one scoop contains 3630 milligrams of leucine and 907 milligrams of isoleucine and valine. Muscle Feasts recommends mixing one scoop with 12 ounces of water or your favorite beverage.

If you're concerned about manufacturing, Muscle Feast adheres to strict standards and is third-party tested by Labdoor. The gluten-free, soy-free powder is made in an FDA-registered facility.

<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:23px;"><b>Best Flavored: Vital Protiens Recovery BCCA Powder</b></p></a>
    <p style="font-size:23px">
  It's hard to find a flavored BCAA supplement that tastes great and doesn't use questionable sweeteners. Vital Proteins combine 20 grams of their well-known collagen powder with 8 grams of essential amino acids and 5 grams of BCAAs to create a great post-workout recovery drink that's sweetened only with monk fruit. This plant-based sweetener is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA and is less sweet than other sugar alternatives on the market.

The gluten-, dairy-, and soy-free powder comes in five flavors, including guava lime, lemon grape, passionfruit, watermelon berry, and yuzu clementine. Each two-scoop serving contains 100 calories, 6 grams of carbohydrates, and 18 grams of protein. The delicious blend features many electrolytes and vitamins, including 50 percent of your daily value of vitamin C and vitamin B6. Natural electrolytes from coconut water powder help to rehydrate, while taurine and glutamine support muscle recovery.

<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:23px;"><b>Best Plant-Based: Nutiva Hemp Seed Protein Powder</b></p></a>
    <p style="font-size:23px">
 Many BCAA supplements contain milk or other non-vegan-friendly ingredients such as bovine gelatin in the capsules. If you're looking for a more natural, plant-based product, try Nutiva Hemp Seed Protein Powder. The USDA Organic, Cold-Pressed, Raw Protein Powder contains 15 grams of protein per 3-tablespoon serving, containing 0.5 grams isoleucine, 0.8 grams leucine, and 0.7 grams valine.

The vegan, non-GMO product tastes great and is easy to blend into your favorite smoothie. While this product may contain lower amounts of BCAAs than other supplements on this list, hemp is a high-quality superfood that has additional benefits such as dietary fiber, magnesium, and iron.

     <p class="p"><b>Good to know:</b> <br><br>BCAA supplements come in different ratios of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Leucine is generally in higher ratios, such as with the common 2:1:1 (leucine: isoleucine: valine) ratio, as it is thought to be especially good at supporting skeletal muscle synthesis. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
